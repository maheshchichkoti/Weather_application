# WeatherAPI
An API I've created to find out the current weather for a given location
## Motivation
This project helped me understand the vast utility of APIs and their benefits. By utilising the Open Weather Map API from RapidAPI, I was able to obtain weather data in JSON format which I parsed and displayed on JSP pages.

## Languages

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
## Technologies used
